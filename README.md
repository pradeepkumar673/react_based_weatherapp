React Weather App
A React-based Weather Application with login functionality that allows users to check current weather conditions of cities and towns. Users can view key details such as temperature, weather description, and wind speed.

This project was built as part of my Full Stack Web Development learning journey (Week 10 & 11), where I independently developed about 80% of the app and used AI assistance (~20%) mainly for debugging and error fixing.
